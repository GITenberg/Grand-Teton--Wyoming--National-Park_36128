<h2><a name="GRAND_TETON" id="GRAND_TETON"></a>GRAND TETON<br />
<i><small>National Park</small></i></h2>

<p class="center">OPEN FROM JUNE 1 TO OCTOBER 15</p>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Grand Teton National Park</span> embraces the most scenic portion
of the Teton Range of Wyoming, with an area of approximately 150
square miles, or 96,000 acres. It varies from 3 to 9 miles in width
and is 27 miles in length. The northern extremity of the park is about
11 miles south of the southern boundary of Yellowstone National Park.
This park was established by President Coolidge on February 26, 1929.</p>

<p>In addition to its sublime peaks and canyons, the Grand Teton National
Park includes six large lakes and many smaller bodies of water, glaciers,
and snowfields, and extensive forests of pine, fir, spruce, cottonwood, and
aspen. However, much of the park area is above timber line (10,500 feet),
the Grand Teton rising to more than 7,000 feet above the floor of Jackson
Hole.</p>

<p>The great array of peaks which constitutes the scenic climax of this
national park is one of the noblest in the world. It is alpine in the truest
sense. Southwest of Jenny Lake is a culminating group of lofty peaks
whose dominating figure is the Grand Teton, the famous mountain after
which the park takes its name. The resemblance of this group, whose
clustered, tapering spires tower aloft to a height of thousands of feet and
are hung with never-melting snowfields, to a vast cathedral, must suggest
itself to every observer.</p>

<p>However widely traveled, visitors viewing the Tetons for the first time
confess that the beauty of this park and the rugged grandeur of its mountains
come to them as a distinct revelation. This is amply proved by the
increasingly large number of visitors who return summer after summer to
spend their vacations in the Grand Teton National Park. The recreational
possibilities of these mountains, they have found, are practically limitless.
Here they may camp on the lakes, swim and fish, ride or hike the trails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
engage in the strenuous sport of mountaineering, or&mdash;if their needs and
wishes so dictate&mdash;simply relax and rest.</p>

<p>The Grand, Middle, and South Tetons comprise the historic <i>Trois Tetons</i>,
which were noted landmarks to the trappers and explorers of the early
nineteenth century. The Three Tetons are seen to best advantage from
the west and southwest. As the observer's viewpoint is shifted, the major
peaks change greatly in outline and relative position, but despite this fact
one soon learns to recognize each.</p>

<p>Eleven peaks are of such boldness and prominence that they receive
rank as major peaks. In order of descending altitude they are: Grand
Teton, 13,766 feet; Mount Owen, 12,922; Middle Teton, 12,798; Mount
Moran 12,594; South Teton, 12,505; Mount Teewinot, 12,317; Buck
Mountain, 11,923; Nez Perce, 11,900; Mount Woodring, 11,585; Mount
Wister, 11,480; and Mount St. John, 11,412.</p>

<p>In addition to the 11 major peaks there are an even larger number of
lesser prominence and altitude, such as Cloudveil Dome, 12,026 feet;
Eagle Rest, 11,257; Prospectors Mountain, 11,231; Mount Rockchuck,
11,150; Table Mountain, 11,075; Bivouac Peak, 11,045; Rendezvous Peak,
10,924; Fossil Mountain, 10,912; Rolling Thunder, 10,902; Mount Hunt,
10,775; Symmetry Spire, 10,546; and Storm Point, 10,040, as well as a
host of nameless pinnacles and crags which serve still further to make the
Teton skyline the most jagged of any on the continent. The larger lakes
of the park&mdash;Leigh, String, Jenny, Bradley, Taggart, and Phelps&mdash;all lie
close to the foot of the range and, like beads, are linked together by the
sparkling, tumbling waters of Cottonwood Creek and neighboring streams.
Nestled in dense forests outside the mouths of canyons, these lakes mirror
in their quiet depths nearby peaks whose pointed summits rise with sheer
slopes a mile or more above their level.</p>

<h2><a name="HISTORY_OF_THE_REGION" id="HISTORY_OF_THE_REGION"></a>HISTORY OF THE REGION</h2>


<p>Many of our national parks have been carved from wilderness areas
previously little known to man and but seldom visited. The Tetons, on
the contrary, are remarkably rich in historic associations. The Grand
Teton itself has been referred to by an eminent historian as "the most
noted historic summit of the West."</p>

<p>Up to the beginning of the last century Indians held undisputed sway
over the country dominated by the Three Tetons. Then, as now, Jackson
Hole was literally a happy hunting ground, and, while the severe winters
precluded permanent habitation, during the milder seasons, bands of Indians
frequently came into the basin on hunting or warring expeditions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
They represented many tribes, usually hostile to each other. The dreaded
Blackfeet, the Crows, the Nez Perce, the Flatheads, the Shoshoni, and
others. There is little reason to believe that these Indians ever invaded
the more rugged portions of the Tetons, but it is certain they regularly
crossed the range, utilizing the several passes.</p>

<p>The Tetons probably first became known to white men in 1807-8, when
the intrepid John Colter crossed the range, presumably near Teton Pass
on the memorable journey which also made him discoverer of the Yellowstone
country. In 1811 the Astorians, under Wilson Price Hunt, entered
Jackson Hole by the Hoback Canyon and, failing in an attempt to navigate
the Snake River, likewise crossed the Teton Range in the vicinity of Teton
Pass, continuing thence to the mouth of the Columbia, where the trading
post, Astoria, was founded. The Tetons also figure in the adventures of
the returning Astorians in 1812. In Washington Irving's classic account
of the Astorian expedition (Astoria, published in 1836) the name "Tetons"
first appears in literature.</p>

<p>The decades which follow may truly be referred to as "the Fur Era", for
the Tetons became the center of remarkable activities on the part of fur
trappers representing both British and American interests, the former by
the Northwest and Hudson's Bay Companies, the latter by a succession of
companies operating out of St. Louis, Mo. "It was the trio of peaks so distinctively
presented from the west and southwest that made the Tetons
famous as landmarks among the roving trappers who, guiding their courses
by these easily recognized summits, singly or in groups passed over Teton
Pass and through Pierres Hole in their seasonal migrations to and from their
remote hunting grounds." Could these ancient monuments speak they
would make known some of the most interesting events in the annals of
the fur trade. For this was the paradise of the trapper. In every direction
meandered the streams along which he pursued his trade, and nearby were
the valleys where the rival companies gathered in annual conclave to fight
the bloodless battles of their business. There is scarcely an acre of open
country in sight of it that has not been the scene of forgotten struggles with
the implacable Blackfeet, while far and near, in unknown graves, lie many
obscure wanderers of whose lonely fate no record survives. Captain
Bonneville, Father DeSmet, Rev. Samuel Parker, Jedediah Smith, Bridger,
Kit Carson, David Jackson (after whom Jackson Hole and Jackson Lake
were named), Sublette, Joe Meek&mdash;these are names to conjure with in
western history. These and many others equally distinguished appear in
the records of the Teton country, particularly in the third and fourth
decades of the century. The 1832 rendezvous of the American trappers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
was held in Teton Basin, then known as "Pierre's Hole", at the west base
of the Tetons. It was attended by many of the most famous trappers of
the time, and furnished occasion for the Battle of Pierre's Hole, a notable
engagement between the trappers and Gros Ventres.</p>

<p>The picturesque name "Jackson Hole" dates back to 1829, in which year
Capt. William Sublette so named it after his fellow trapper, David E.
Jackson, who was especially partial to this beautiful valley. The term
"hole" was used by the trappers of that period in much the same sense as
is the word "basin" today, being applied to any mountain-girt valley.</p>

<p>In the 1840's the value of beaver skins declined and with it the fur trade.
By 1845 the romantic trapper of "the Fur Era" had vanished from the
Rockies&mdash;not, however, without having won for himself an imperishable
place in American history. During the next four decades the valleys near
the Tetons were largely deserted, except for wandering bands of Indians
that still occasionally drifted in. But the frontier was relentlessly closing
in, and one Government expedition after another passed through the Teton
country or skirted its borders. Most important of these were the Hayden
surveys, which in 1871, 1872, 1877, and 1878 sent parties into the region.
The names of several members of the 1872 expedition are perpetuated in
connection with Leigh, Jenny, Bradley, and Taggart Lakes. Orestes St.
John, geologist with the 1877 Hayden party, and the great artist, Thomas
Moran, who in 1879 went with a military escort to paint the Tetons, are
similarly remembered in the names of two of the principal peaks. To this
transition period also belong the earliest prospectors of Jackson Hole, as
well as several famous big-game hunters who came here in search of
trophies&mdash;forerunners of the hundreds of hunters who now annually invade
this region.</p>

<p>In the middle eighties came the first settlers. They entered by the Gros
Ventre River and Teton Pass, and to begin with naturally settled in the
south end of the hole. Here as elsewhere the story of the homesteader has
been one of isolation, privations, and hardships, met, however, with persistency
and indomitable courage. Nor is the story confined to the past,
for maintaining a livelihood amongst these mountains still calls for resourcefulness,
fortitude, and&mdash;not infrequently&mdash;even heroism.</p>

<p>History, here, is still in the making. Teton Forest Reserve was not
created until 1897; the railroad reached Victor in 1912; the Jackson Lake
Dam was finished in 1914; many of the roads and bridges of the region were
constructed within the past decade; and the Grand Teton National Park
was created in 1929. The detailed exploration of the range and the conquest
of its high peaks have taken place in relatively recent years, and since
1929 trails have been built which for the first time make the Tetons really
accessible to the public.</p>

<p>In later paragraphs will be found an account of the mountaineering
history of the Tetons. And so the dramatic human story of these mountains
is brought down to the present.</p>

<h2><a name="GEOGRAPHIC_FEATURES" id="GEOGRAPHIC_FEATURES"></a>GEOGRAPHIC FEATURES</h2>


<h3>THE TETON RANGE</h3>

<p>On the Jackson Hole side the Teton Range presents one of the most precipitous
mountain fronts on the continent. Except for Teton Pass, at its
southern end, the range is practically an insuperable barrier. Forty miles
in length, it springs abruptly from Jackson Hole and only a few miles west
of its base attains elevations of more than 13,000 feet above the sea. Thus
most of the range is lifted above timber line into the realm of perpetual
snow, and in its deeper recesses small glaciers still linger. The grandeur
of the beetling gray crags, sheer precipices, and perennial snow fields,
is vastly enhanced on this side by the total absence of foothills and by
contrast with the relatively flat floor of Jackson Hole, from which they
are usually viewed.</p>

<p>The Teton Range may be described as a long block of the earth that has
been broken and uplifted along its eastern margin, thus being tilted westward.
Movement of this sort along a fracture is what the geologist terms
"faulting." The total amount of uplift along the eastern edge of the block
amounts to more than 10,000 feet. Doubtless this uplift was accomplished
not by one cataclysm but by a series of small faulting movements distributed
over a very long period. Probably the time of faulting was as remote as
the middle of the Tertiary period (the period just before the Ice Age, the
latest chapter of the earth's history).</p>

<p>Very impressive is the contrast between the east and west sides of the
Teton Range. From the east, the Jackson Hole side, one views the precipitous
side of the mountain block as it has been exposed by uplift and
erosion. From the west, the Idaho side, is seen the broad top of the block,
which is gently inclined toward the west. In the eastern front, furthermore,
one sees the ancient, deep-seated crystalline rocks (gneiss, schist, and
pegmatite) belonging to the earliest known geologic eras, the pre-Cambrian.
In places on the top of the block, at the head of Death and Avalanche
Canyons, for example, are seen the inclined layers of limestone, quartzite,
and shale belonging to the less ancient Paleozoic era. These layers
formerly covered the entire block, but they have been worn away
from half of the area, thus exposing the underlying crystallines. The west
and north flanks of the range are overlapped by relatively young beds
of lava that are continuous with those covering eastern Idaho and the
Yellowstone plateaus.</p>

<h3>JACKSON HOLE</h3>

<p>Jackson Hole, which adjoins the park on the southeast, is one of the most
sequestered valleys in the Rockies, encompassed on all sides as it is by
mountain barriers. It is 48 miles long, for the most part 6 to 8 miles wide,
and embraces an area of more than 400 square miles. The floor of the
valley slopes from an altitude of 7,000 feet at the north end to 6,000 at
the south. Jackson Hole lies a few miles west of the Continental Divide,
and occupies the central portion of the headwaters area of the Snake River.
Mountain streams converge radially toward it from the surrounding highlands,
and the Snake River receives these as it flows through the valley.</p>

<p>Jackson Hole has largely been excavated by the Snake River and its
tributaries from the shale formations which once extended over the region
to a depth of several thousand feet. Rocks surrounding the region, being
more resistant, were reduced less rapidly and therefore have been left
standing in relief as highlands.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THE_WORK_OF_GLACIERS" id="THE_WORK_OF_GLACIERS"></a>THE WORK OF GLACIERS</h2>


<p>Here, as in several other national parks, the glaciers of the Ice Age,
known to the geologist as the Pleistocene period, played a leading role in
developing the extraordinary scenic features. Just as the streams now converge
toward Jackson Hole, so in ages past glaciers moved down toward,
and in many instances into, the basin from the highlands to the east, north,
and west. Detailed study has shown that the Ice Age was not a single,
simple episode, but is divisible into "stages"&mdash;glacial stages, during which
extensive ice fields formed, and interglacial stages, during which these were
largely or wholly withdrawn. The duration of each is to be thought of
in terms of tens of thousands of years. In Jackson Hole, three glacial and
two interglacial stages have been recognized. Only the most recent glacial
stage need concern us here, the other two having occurred so long ago that
their records are much obscured.</p>

<p>This stage ended but yesterday, geologically speaking, and to it is due
much of the grandeur of the region. In the Teton Range every canyon
from Phillips northward contained a glacier, and many of these reached
eastward to the base of the range where they spread widely upon the floor
of Jackson Hole. Where Jackson Lake now is there lay a great, sluggish
field of ice resulting from the confluence of adjacent alpine glaciers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Moraines, outwash plains, and lakes are easily recognizable features that
originated during the latest glacial stages, and most of the peaks and
canyons were greatly modified.</p>

<p>Moraines are deposits of debris, piled up by the ice itself. Such are the
heavily wooded, hummocky embankments which rest along the base of the
mountains from Granite Canyon northward, rising in some cases 200 or
300 feet above the floor of Jackson Hole and heaped with enormous
boulders quarried by the ice far back in the range.</p>

<p>With two exceptions each of the large moraines incloses a lake. In this
way Phelps, Taggart, Bradley, Jenny, Leigh, and Jackson Lakes originated;
all ranged along the western border of Jackson Hole. No lakes were
formed along the eastern border, inasmuch as on this side no glaciers extended
beyond their canyons. String Lake is dammed in part by a gravel fill.</p>

<p>Outwash plains are the deposits formed by streams which, during the Ice
Age, issued from the glaciers. Of this origin are the broad, cobble-strewn
flats, usually overgrown with sage, which cover the floor of Jackson Hole.
They are diversified by bars, abandoned stream channels, terraces and
"pitted plains", features of exceptional interest to one who examines them
in detail. Several isolated buttes&mdash;Signal, Blacktail, and the Gros Ventre
Buttes&mdash;rise like islands a thousand feet or more above these flats.</p>

<p>Each canyon gives evidence of the vigor with which the glacier it once
contained gouged out its channel. In many places the rock of the broad
floors and steep sides is still remarkably polished. Every canyon leads up
to one or more amphitheaters, or cirques, with sheer bare walls hundreds
of feet high. Tracing these ice-gouged canyons headward one will discover
many rock-rimmed lakelets, some hung on precipitous mountain sides
where one might be pardoned for asserting that no lake could possibly exist.</p>

<h2><a name="TRAILS" id="TRAILS"></a>TRAILS</h2>


<p>An unbroken wilderness a few years ago, the Grand Teton National Park
is now penetrated by some of the finest trails in the national-park system.
These trails, suitable alike for travel afoot or on saddle horses, are 3 to 4
feet wide, free of boulders, and of grade so moderate they may be followed
by old or young with full safety and a minimum of physical exertion. While
the trails are traversable during the greater part of the summer, some of
them may be blocked by snow early in the season. Those visitors expecting
to climb the high trails should inquire at park headquarters or the office at
the museum at Jenny Lake for information regarding the condition of the
high trails.</p>

<p><b><i>The Lakes Trail</i></b> runs parallel to the mountains, following closely the
base of the range and skirting the shore of each large body of water from
Leigh Lake at the north to Phelps Lake at the south. It makes accessible
the most important lakes, canyons, and peaks of the park, and is naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the one from which all expeditions into the range begin. One can encircle
by trail either Jenny Lake or String Lake, the hike around the former being
one of the most popular in the park.</p>

<p><b><i>The Canyon Trails</i></b> described below are spur trails extending westward
from the Lakes Trail, back into the most rugged areas in the Teton Range.
Intervening canyons have been left in their splendid wildness.</p>

<p><b><i>The Teton Glacier Trail</i></b> extends up the east slope of the Grand Teton
to two alpine lakes, Surprise and Amphitheater, at altitudes close to 10,000
feet. By means of the 17 switchbacks on this trail the hiker or horseman
climbs to a point on the face of the Grand Teton, 3,000 feet above the floor
of the valley, throughout this ascent enjoying matchless panoramas of the
entire Jackson Hole country, and witnesses a view extending eastward
80 miles to the Wind River Mountains, whose peaks and glaciers are
sharply outlined against the horizon. Amphitheater Lake, at the end of the
trail, occupies a protected glacial cirque and is the starting point for Teton
Glacier, the most accessible of the ice fields, three-fourths of a mile northwest
from the end of the trail. Though seasoned hikers make the climb
from Jenny Lake to the glacier by way of this trail, one can, if he chooses,
take horses as far as Amphitheater Lake, and continue on foot with a guide
over to the glacier.</p>

<p><b><i>The Indian Paintbrush Trail</i></b> starts near the outlet of Leigh Lake and
follows up the bottom of Indian Paintbrush Canyon to connect with the
Cascade Canyon Trail by way of Lake Solitude, a lakelet of rarest beauty
at timber line near the head of the north fork of Cascade Canyon. The
wealth of wild flowers along this trail gives name to the canyon, and early
or late in the day one may see big game, especially moose, near the lakes
and swamps. This trail affords superb views of Jackson and Leigh Lakes
eastward beyond the mouth of the canyon, and westward along the Divide
glimpses of snowclad ridges and peaks.</p>

<p><b><i>The Cascade Canyon Trail</i></b> passes through a chasm whose walls rise
sheer on either side for thousands of feet. By this trail one penetrates into
the deepest recesses of the Tetons. It skirts the base of several of the
noblest peaks, Teewinot, Mount Owen, Table Mountain, and the Three
Tetons, and it enables one to see these titans not only at close range but
from new and impressive angles. Lake Solitude may be reached by means
of this trail, by taking the Cascade Canyon-Indian Paintbrush loop trail
leading up the north fork of Cascade Canyon.</p>

<p><b><i>The Death Canyon Trail</i></b> traverses the full length of a canyon which in
its lower portion is of profound depth and grandeur, as awesome as its
name, but which above opens into broad, sunny meadows. No canyon
better illustrates the difference between the rugged, alpine landscapes
developed in the crystalline rock of the Teton east border and the softer
contours formed in the sedimentary strata to the west, near the Divide.</p>

<p><b><i>The Skyline Trail</i></b> is that portion of the trail system which connects the
Indian Paintbrush, Cascade Canyon, and Death Canyon Trails. Following
down the north fork, then up the south fork of Cascade Canyon, it
crosses the head of Avalanche Canyon to Alaska Basin, in the western
watershed of the Tetons, thence over a high saddle on Buck Mountain and
down a series of switchbacks to join the Death Canyon Trail. This trail
takes the hiker, or rider, through alpine meadows to rugged cliffs and ledges
above timber line from which can be viewed to the westward the valleys
and mountains of Idaho, as well as the Wyoming country to the east as far
as the Wind River Range. In traversing this loop one completely encircles
the three Tetons and adjacent high peaks, viewing them from all sides, and
learns to know them with an intimacy impossible to the visitor who contents
himself with distant views.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="MOUNTAIN_CLIMBING" id="MOUNTAIN_CLIMBING"></a>MOUNTAIN CLIMBING</h2>


<p>Among American climbers no range enjoys higher rank than the Tetons,
and its growing fame abroad is evidenced by increasingly large numbers
of foreign mountaineers who come here to climb. Leading mountaineers
unhesitatingly rank many of the Teton climbs with the best in the Alps and
other world-famous climbing centers. Though the majority of climbs must
be considered difficult even for mountaineers of skill and wide experience,
there are several peaks, notably the Middle Teton, South Teton, and Mount
Woodring, which have relatively easy routes that may be safely followed
by anyone of average strength.</p>

<p>Although the conquest of the Tetons has largely been accomplished
within the decade just closed, the beginnings of mountaineering go back
nearly a century. Naturally the Grand Teton was first to be challenged
and the Wyoming historian, Coutant, records that in 1843 a French
explorer, Michaud, with a well-organized party, attempted its ascent but
was stopped short of the summit by unscalable cliffs. It is possible that
even earlier white men&mdash;trappers and explorers&mdash;matched their strength
and strategy against this peak or others in the Tetons, but if so their efforts
have gone unrecorded. From the period of the Hayden surveys in the
seventies, accounts of several attempts have come down to us, and one
party, consisting of N. P. Langford and James Stevenson, purported to
have reached the summit on July 29, 1872. This claim to first ascent has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
been generally discredited because of the serious discrepancies between
Langford's published account and the actual conditions on the peak as
now known. In 1891 and again in 1897 William O. Owen, pioneer
Wyoming surveyor, headed attempts to reach the summit which likewise
failed. Finally in 1898 a party sponsored by the Rocky Mountain Club,
of Colorado, and comprising Owen, Bishop Franklin S. Spalding, John
Shive, and Frank Petersen, on August 11 discovered the traverse which,
700 feet beneath the summit, leads around the northwest face and so
opens up a clear route to the top.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The conquest of the Grand Teton achieved, public interest waned and a
quarter century elapsed before the peak was again scaled. In 1923 two
parties retraced the route of 1898, and each year thereafter numerous
ascents have been made. In recent years as many as 30 to 40 parties
have climbed the peak each summer.</p>

<p>Repeated efforts were made to achieve the summit of the Grand Teton by
routes other than the traditional one, and in 1929 one of these resulted in
a successful ascent of the east ridge by Kenneth A. Henderson and Robert
L. M. Underhill. In 1931 no less than three additional routes were discovered:
the southwest ridge was climbed by Glenn Exum; the southeast ridge
by Underhill, Phil Smith, and Frank Truslow; and the north face by
Underhill and Fritiof Fryxell. In 1936 a second route up the extremely
hazardous north face was established by Paul and Eldon Petzoldt and Jack
Durrance. Thus, six wholly distinct routes have been employed on this
mountain, though only the traditional route and possibly the southwest
ridge can be recommended to any except most expert alpinists.</p>

<p>Within the last decade other peaks in the range have come in for more
and more attention. This they richly deserve, since from both a scenic and
mountaineering standpoint many of them are worthy peers of the Grand
Teton itself. Mount Moran, Mount Owen, Teewinot, Nez Perce, and the
Middle Teton comprise a mountain assemblage which, for nobility of
form and grandeur, would be difficult to equal anywhere.</p>

<p>So far as known, Buck Mountain, most southerly of the "Matterhorn
peaks", was the first major peak in the range to be scaled, the ascent being
made early in 1898 by the topographical party of T. M. Bannon.
Thereafter no important ascents were made until 1919, when LeRoy
Jeffers scaled the lower summit of Mount Moran. The main summit of
this peak was first climbed in 1922 by L. H. Hardy, Ben C. Rich, and
Bennet McNulty. In 1923 A. R. Ellingwood climbed both the Middle and
South Tetons on the same day, on the South Teton being accompanied by
Eleanor Davis. In 1928 Mount Wister was climbed by Phil Smith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Oliver Zierlein; in 1929 Teewinot and Mount St. John by Fryxell and
Smith; in 1930 Nez Perce by Fryxell and Smith; and Mount Owen by
Underhill, Henderson, Fryxell, and Smith. With the ascent of Mount
Owen the conquest of the major peaks, begun so many years before, was at
length completed.</p>

<p>In the meantime the minor peaks were by no means neglected, the first
ascents being made principally since 1929 by the climbers whose names
have already been mentioned. As in the case of the Grand Teton, a
variety of routes have been worked out on almost all of the major and
minor peaks. Between 1929 and 1931 the important summits of the range
were equipped with standard Government register tubes and register
books, in which climbers may enter records of their ascents. The story
of the conquest of the Tetons is told in a book entitled "The Teton Peaks

<h3>SUGGESTIONS TO CLIMBERS</h3>

<p>Since 1931 authorized guide service has been available in the park. In
view of the difficulties one encounters on the Teton peaks and the hazards
they present, prospective climbers&mdash;especially if inexperienced&mdash;are urged
to make use of the guide service. If venturing out unguided, climbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
should under all circumstances consult rangers or guides for full information
relative to routes and equipment. Failure to heed this caution has, in the
past, led to accidents and even fatalities. Climbing parties <i>are required,
under all circumstances</i>, to report at either park headquarters or Jenny Lake
Ranger Station before and after each expedition, whether guided or
unguided. <i>Climbing alone, without a companion, is absolutely prohibited.</i></p>

<p>The climbing season varies with the amount of snow in the range and the
character of the weather, but ordinarily it extends from the middle of June
to the end of September, being at its best during July, August, and early
September. In most cases it is advisable to allow 2 days for an ascent of the
Grand Teton, Mount Owen, or Mount Moran, and one day for the other
major peaks. Jenny Lake Campground is the logical outfitting point for
most expeditions; it is close to the peaks and the sources of supply as well.
For most ascents the usual alpine equipment&mdash;ice axes, rope, and hobbed
boots or climbing shoes&mdash;is essential. In the case of guided parties arrangements
for renting equipment may be made with the guides.</p>

<h2><a name="WILDLIFE" id="WILDLIFE"></a>WILDLIFE</h2>


<p>For a great many years Jackson Hole has been famed for its big game, and
to those who wish to see wild animals the expenditure of a little time in
favorable localities usually will reveal them.</p>

<p>The visitor should not be disappointed if he does not see animals from his
automobile as he drives through the park. In most cases the roads have
been built so as to avoid going through localities inhabited by wildlife for
fear of frightening it and driving it away.</p>

<p>Within the actual confines of the park, Shiras' moose is the most common
big game animal, and it is frequently seen in the smaller ponds and marshy
meadows. Though the moose is the largest member of the deer family, it
is not as wary as the deer and is comparatively easy to see.</p>

<p>Mule deer are increasing in the park, as well as in the rest of Jackson Hole.
Though quite shy, they are often seen along the many miles of trail which
are accessible to both rider and hiker.</p>

<p>The elk, or wapati, have been the most important of the big game animals
in Jackson Hole, at least since the occupancy of white men; and they have
done much to make the valley known to the world. Their history constitutes
one of the most interesting chapters in the story of the valley. Not
many years ago as the winter range of the elk was more and more taken up
by the cattleman and rancher, depriving the elk of the areas where they
might find winter forage not too deeply covered by winter snow, it became
apparent that something must be done to save these magnificent animals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Toward this end a Government ranch was established near the town of
Jackson, where the elk could be fed during the winter months. The preservation
of the Jackson Hole elk herd is now assured.</p>

<p>In the spring elk leave the low country and the Government feed grounds
and move toward the high country in Yellowstone Park and south of it,
on Big Game Ridge, the Thorofare Plateau, and in the mountains east of
Jackson Hole. A small herd summers in the north end of the Teton Range.
With snowfall in the high country, the elk again move down until by
November or December they are back on the feed grounds.</p>

<p>A small herd of bighorns, or Rocky Mountain sheep, ranges in the Teton
Mountains. Large numbers of bighorns are found, however, in the mountains
east and south of Jackson Hole.</p>

<p>In the park there are many smaller mammals, among them the marmot,
or "rockchuck", whose shrill whistling makes his presence known at all
altitudes from the valley floor to the peak summits. Marmots make interesting
pets, and tame ones are not uncommon. Like bears, marmots
hibernate through the winter.</p>

<p>Conies (pikas) are common throughout the rock slides, where these little
animals find numerous refuges. They are guinea-piglike creatures, usually
grayish in color and 7 or 8 inches long. In the rock slides one may find the
little hay piles which they make of the plants growing nearby. Though very
little is known concerning the winter habits of these alpine animals, it is
probable that they do not hibernate but during the winter live on their
stored hay and what additional food is to be found under the snow.</p>

<p>Bears are found only in the mountains and canyons of the park. <i>They do
not invade the campgrounds.</i></p>

<p>That most interesting of smaller mammals, the beaver, is common, and it
is not difficult to find the houses and dams which they have built. In the
campgrounds are pine squirrels, chipmunks, ground squirrels, and mice.
Mink, marten, otter, weasels, coyotes, badgers, fox, and lynx also are found
in the park.</p>

<p>The Grand Teton National Park offers much to the bird student.
Though the region is old in history, it is new in possibilities of avian observation,
and the seeker finds types from those which inhabit the arid sagebrush
plains to those which spend their lives in the frigid atmosphere far
above timber line.</p>

<p>In number, there are more than 100 species, a variety which will keep any
ornithologist busy for as long as his stay permits. A list of 93 species was
made during June and July 1933, and at least 3 more species were added
in 1934. Many of these are easily studied within a few hundred yards of
the Jenny Lake Ranger Station.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="TREES_AND_PLANTS" id="TREES_AND_PLANTS"></a>TREES AND PLANTS</h2>


<p>In several respects the flora of the Tetons is unique. The high mountains
have constituted a barrier to plant migration which many forms could not
cross; hence the range limit of a number of plants is found here. Representatives
from north, south, east, and west are found in this general region,
this being the limit, in many instances, of their distribution. There are
many plants typical of the central Rockies, and a few known only to this
range. Five life zones are recognized within the park, all occurring in a
distance of less than 15 miles. Plants migrating from other regions have
grown equally well in each zone.</p>

<p>The flowering period begins in the park as soon as the ridges and flats
are free of snow in May, and it continues until about August 15 in the
Arctic-Alpine Zone. Hence, plants of at least one zone and usually of
several may be seen blooming at any time in the spring or summer.</p>

<p>The evergreen trees form an appropriate frame for the majestic Teton
peaks and are reflected in the beautiful lakes which they encircle.</p>

<p>Lodgepole pine is the most common tree, covering the floor of the valley
and extending up the mountains to about 8,000 feet. The pines may be
easily distinguished from the other evergreens by the long slender needles
occurring in bundles. Lodgepole has two needles in each bundle. Trees of
this species were extensively used by the Indians for lodge poles.</p>

<p>Whitebark pine is the tree of timber line; the occasional specimens found
at a lower elevation are usually dwarfed. Needles occur five in each bundle;
cones 2 to 3 inches long and almost ovate; the tree is much-branched and
of medium size.</p>

<p>Douglas tree has been called "Douglas spruce", "Douglas fir", and "red
fir"; however, it is neither a spruce nor a fir but is worthy of separate distinction.
One needle; cones 2 to 4 inches long; a three-lobed bract projects
from beneath each scale of the cone, a very distinctive character; common
at middle elevations.</p>

<p>Alpine fir grows from the base of the mountains to timber line; at high
altitudes it is dwarfed and sprawling. One needle, flat; cones 2 to 3 inches
long, scales paper-like; tree usually pyramidal and beautifully symmetrical.</p>

<p>Engelmann spruce is the largest tree in the park, and is usually found
growing in moist places and near the lakes and streams. One needle, square
in cross section, stiff and sharp; cones 2 to 3 inches long, scales papery.</p>

<p>Blue spruce is not common and is found only in the Snake River bottoms.
The form found here is not typical, lacking the blue cast. One needle,
square in cross section, stiff and sharp; cones 3 to 5 inches long, scales
papery.</p>

<p>Creeping juniper is not common. It is a prostrate form, lacking definite
trunk. Leaves awllike, one-half inch long or less, stiff and sharp, spreading
from the twigs; fruit, berrylike.</p>

<p>Aspen is the most common deciduous tree of the valley, growing on the
slopes up to about 8,000 feet. The leaves are on very slender stalks and the
slightest breeze puts them into motion, hence the popular names "Quaking
asp" and "Quaking aspen." Leaves rounded, 1 to 3 inches broad, with
a slender stalk of about the same length; bark smooth and whitish.</p>

<p>Balsam poplar is found along some of the stream banks and is the largest
deciduous tree of the park. Leaves about 3 inches long and 2 inches broad,
longer than the stalk; bark smooth on the young trees, becoming rough as
the trees get older. The small seed pods contain many seeds, to each of
which is attached a tuft of white hair or "cotton"; hence one of the common
names, "Cottonwood."</p>

<h2><a name="NATURALIST_SERVICE" id="NATURALIST_SERVICE"></a>NATURALIST SERVICE</h2>


<p>At Jenny Lake is located the park museum, which also serves as the
ranger station. In it are housed exhibits pertaining to the history, geology,
fauna, and flora of the Teton-Jackson Hole country. The collection devoted
to mountaineering is in many respects unique. Adjacent to the
museum is an open-air amphitheater where campfire talks on geology,
wildlife, and other subjects related to the park are given every evening at
dusk by a ranger-naturalist. A nature walk, auto caravan, or all-day hike
is conducted each day by a member of the ranger-naturalist staff.</p>

<h2><a name="FISHING" id="FISHING"></a>FISHING</h2>


<p>Grand Teton Park offers splendid opportunities for fishing. Fish may
be taken with the artificial fly during most of the summer, but the lake or
mackinaw trout which are present in Jackson and Jenny Lakes must be
lured with bait and caught with heavy tackle by means of trolling. Other
species of trout in park waters are the cutthroat (also known as native, red-throat,
and blackspotted) and the brook or speckled trout. The park
waters are being stocked through the cooperation of the United States
Bureau of Fisheries. A Wyoming fishing license, costing $1.50 for State
residents and $3 for nonresidents, is required. For $1.50, however, nonresidents
may secure a 5-day fishing permit.</p>

<h2><a name="HUNTING" id="HUNTING"></a>HUNTING</h2>


<p>Jackson Hole has long been a noted hunting country, and under Wyoming
laws elk, deer, sheep, moose, and bear may be hunted in the mountains
east and south of Jackson Hole. Parties interested in hunting should
consult the local game warden or the State Fish and Game Department at
Cheyenne, Wyo., for information as to licenses and seasons.</p>

<p>No hunting is permitted in the Grand Teton National Park, which, of
course, will always be a complete sanctuary for wildlife.</p>

from the old familiar courses to embrace vast areas in Wyoming and
Montana. A veritable invasion of eastern tourists, known in the parlance
of men of the range as "dudes", has followed the opening up by modern
transportation of this beautiful country.</p>

<p>Located in the mountainous regions of these two far western States, on
the last frontier, are the dude ranches, in the mouths of canyons, among
foothills, or in clearings in the forest. These ranches are not pretentious
places, but are rustic and unique. Their popularity began in 1904, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Howard, Willis, and Alden Eaton established the now famous Eaton
Brothers' "Dude Ranch" at Wolf, Wyo.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_TO_REACH_THE_PARK" id="HOW_TO_REACH_THE_PARK"></a>HOW TO REACH THE PARK</h2>


<h3>BY AUTOMOBILE</h3>

<p>The Grand Teton National Park is reached by automobile from the north,
south, east, and west. Each of these approaches is highly scenic in character
affording splendid distant views of the Teton Range and Jackson
Hole. United States Highway No. 287 connects Jackson Hole with
Yellowstone Park and is the north approach to the Teton Park. One mile
north of Moran the traveler reaches United States Highway No. 187 which
traverses Jackson Hole and makes the park accessible. From the east
United States Highway No. 287, known as the Atlantic-Yellowstone-Pacific
Highway, enters Jackson Hole through Togwotee Pass, altitude 9,658 feet,
and the Buffalo Fork of the Snake River, joining the road from Yellowstone
Park, 1 mile north of Moran. The south road enters Jackson Hole via
Hoback Canyon. This is an improved highway (US 187) leaving Rock
Springs, Wyo., on the Lincoln Highway. United States Highway No. 89
leading to Kemmerer, Wyo., connects with United States Highway No.
187 at Daniel, Wyo. The western approach road from Idaho, via Teton
Pass, to Wilson and Jackson crosses the Teton Range at an altitude of 8,431
feet. This road connects with the West Yellowstone-Salt Lake City
Highway (U S 191) at Sugar City, Idaho, or by traveling via Pine Creek
Pass and Swan Valley, at Idaho Falls.</p>


<h3>BY RAILROAD</h3>

<p>At the present time parties may reach the Grand Teton National Park by
using rail lines to several gateways. The Union Pacific System has its
nearest terminal at Victor, Idaho. It operates daily trains to and from
Victor in the tourist season, and there is bus service from the rail terminus
to Jackson, Grand Teton National Park, and Moran. Union Pacific
passengers upon leaving the train at Rock Springs, Wyo., may make connections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
with the mail stage which leaves daily except Sunday to the
Teton region, by way of Hoback Canyon.</p>

<p>For many years the Yellowstone Park Transportation Co. has operated
daily bus service between Old Faithful and Moran. It makes connections
at Old Faithful, which enable passengers coming to Yellowstone Park via
the Union Pacific (West Yellowstone Gateway), Northern Pacific (Gardiner
Gateway), Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy (Cody Gateway), and Chicago,
Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific (Gallatin Gateway), to reach the Grand
Teton National Park.</p>


<h3>BY AIRPLANE</h3>

<p>United Air Lines in its transcontinental route from New York to San
Francisco has a stop at Rock Springs, Wyo., which makes available for
persons of limited time an opportunity to visit the park.</p>

<p>A mail stage leaves Rock Springs daily, except Sunday, for Grand Teton
National Park via the Hoback Canyon.</p>

<p>National Park Airways, connecting with United Air Lines at Salt Lake
City, operates daily during the summer season via Idaho Falls and West
Yellowstone to Butte and Great Falls, Mont.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="POINTS_OF_INTEREST_ALONG_THE_WAY" id="POINTS_OF_INTEREST_ALONG_THE_WAY"></a>POINTS OF INTEREST ALONG THE WAY</h2>


<p>The Grand Teton National Park is located in the interior of a vast
mountain region, and its avenues of approach are, of necessity, through
canyons and passes. These approaches are themselves of great interest and
beauty, and afford magnificent distant views of the Teton Range. The
country traversed is rich in associations of the Old West and contains
numerous historic shrines which deserve the attention of the passing
traveler.</p>

<p>The north approach, from Yellowstone Park by United States Highway
No. 287, passes over the Continental Divide just a few miles south of
West Thumb, and in leaving the Yellowstone Plateau follows the course of
Lewis River. In the dense forests along this wilderness stream there are
opportunities to see big game, such as elk, deer, moose, and bears. Descending
into Jackson Hole, the highway skirts the east shore of Jackson
Lake, and the view of the distant Tetons, rising from the far shore of the
lake, is one the traveler will not soon forget. At this distance they glisten
in delicate blue and white, so sharp they seem actually to bristle.</p>

<p>The west approach, from Salt Lake City and points farther west, leaves
United States Highways Nos. 91 and 191 at Idaho Falls or Sugar City,
Idaho, traverses historic Teton Basin, the "Pierres Hole" of the early
trappers, and passes over Teton Pass, elevation 8,429 feet, to the town of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Jackson, which lies in the south end of Jackson Hole about 15 miles south
of Teton Park headquarters. This approach is the only one from which
the three Tetons, noted landmarks of a century ago, stand out prominently,
and the view of this trio is highly impressive. No less spectacular is the panorama
of Jackson Hole revealed as one reaches the summit of Teton Pass.
Undoubtedly the Teton Pass view is the finest to be had of this basin from
any point on the highways.</p>

<p>The south approach, from Evanston, Kemmerer, Rock Springs, and
other towns in southern Wyoming, follows United States Highway No. 187
or US 89, and avoids all high mountain passes, entering Jackson Hole
by way of the Hoback Canyon. This road does not open up glimpses
of the Tetons until one is well into Jackson Hole, but it affords excellent
views of the snow-clad Wind River Range. Strung along its course is
a series of interesting monuments marking such historic spots as the site
of Fort Bonneville, founded in 1832; the location of the fur trappers'
rendezvous of 1824; the grave of John Hoback, guide to the early expedition
known as "the Astorians"; and similar interesting places. At a point
called "Names Hill", between Kemmerer and Tulsa, Wyo., can be seen
names and dates as old as the 1820's carved in sandstone by the early trappers
and travelers in this region.</p>

<p>The east approach, from the Black Hills, Casper, and points farther
east, crosses the Wind River Range into Jackson Hole over the Continental
Divide at Togwotee Pass, on United States Highway No. 287. If so desired,
in driving from Casper to Lander one can choose the modern road
which retraces part of the Oregon Trail, past such famous landmarks on
the old trail as Independence Rock, Devils Gate, Muddy Gap, Whiskey
Gap, and Split Rock. From Lander or Riverton a visit to the Shoshone
Indian Reservation can be made with little increase of mileage. The
approach to Togwotee Pass from either side is surprisingly fine, and the
view of the Tetons from points just west of this pass is one of the finest
obtainable. For boldness and jaggedness of skyline the Tetons thus seen
from a distance of 40 miles have no rival anywhere.</p>

<h2><a name="ACCOMMODATIONS_AND_EXPENSES" id="ACCOMMODATIONS_AND_EXPENSES"></a>ACCOMMODATIONS AND EXPENSES</h2>


<p>There are no hotels or lodges within the park, but these accommodations
are available nearby at Jackson and Moran at reasonable rates. Dude
ranches and cabin camps near the park also offer suitable accommodations
at reasonable rates. The National Park Service has no control over these
enterprises.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<h3>PUBLIC CAMPGROUNDS</h3>

<p>There is a modern, well-developed campground at Jenny Lake. This
camp is supplied with running water, sanitary facilities, and cooking grates.
There are also many camping sites away from the main campground,
suitable for overnight stops for pack outfits. Supplies, including fishing
tackle, may be procured at Jenny Lake, Moose, Jackson, or Moran.</p>


<h3>SADDLE HORSES</h3>

<p>Grand Teton is primarily a saddle horse park. Access to the interior
of the park is possible only by trails, as no highways have been built or
are planned.</p>

<p>At the south end of Jenny Lake, near the ranger station, there is maintained
an excellent string of saddle and pack horses with good equipment
for short or long trips. One may rent saddle horses without guides, but
only to ride over well-defined trails in designated areas. Discretion as to
the ability of patrons to ride, or to go unguided, rests with the operator.
Saddle-horse trips to special points of interest, such as Teton Glacier, are
made daily at reasonable rates. Pack trips to any part of the park or surrounding
country, with guide, cook, and complete camping equipment may
be taken if arrangements are made in advance.</p>


<h3>BOATING</h3>

<p>At the south end of Jenny Lake also, D. Kenneth Reimers maintains
motorboat and rowboat service. Four or more persons may make a trip
around Jenny Lake for 50 cents each. Rowboats may be rented for 50
cents an hour or $2 a day. Motorboats, with a driver, are $2 an hour,
$1.50 each additional hour, and $10 a day; without a driver, $1.50 an hour,
and $6 a day.</p>


<h3>GUIDE SERVICE</h3>

<p>The authorized official guide for mountain-climbing trips in Grand
Teton National Park is Paul Petzoldt. He maintains summer headquarters
at Jenny Lake, and charges $8 a day, a person, for his services. Climbers
may provide their own food or have their meals at $2 each at a timber
line camp. Blankets and eiderdown sleeping bags may be rented for $2.</p>


<h3>PHOTOGRAPHS</h3>

<p>The Crandall Studios maintain up-to-date picture shops at Jenny Lake
and Moran. Photographs of the Teton Mountains and the surrounding
country in all sizes and styles, as well as hand-painted enlargements, paintings,
moving pictures, and souvenir postcards, are on sale. Laboratories in
the park are maintained for developing, printing, and enlarging photographs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>This booklet is issued once a year, and the rates mentioned herein may have
changed slightly since issuance, but the latest rates approved by the Secretary
of the Interior are on file with the superintendent and the park operators.</p>


<h3>MOTOR TRANSPORTATION</h3>

<p>Regular bus service is maintained between Yellowstone and Moran
Wyo.; also from Moran to Victor, Idaho, via Grand Teton National Park.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
